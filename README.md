If you wish to run this app in your local machine; please make sure that your Rails API is working on your browser localhost, within port:3000. You can find the instructions [HERE](https://github.com/yigitm/book-appointment/edit/API-readme/README.md).

Once your Rails API is running to get a local copy up of the React front end, run the following these steps.
